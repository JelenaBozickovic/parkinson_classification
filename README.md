# parkinson_classification
Student project for Parkinson's classification using SVM. Code written in Matlab. Excuses for papers in Serbian language. If interested, I would be more than happy to translate it to English. 


This is a student project from Pattern Recognition subject. The goal was to try to detect Parkinson's disease from a voice signal parameters such as shimmer, jitter, frequency etc.
Method used in the project was Support Vector Machines, after experimenting with few others(Decision Tree, kNN).
Sensitivity achieved was 80%, which is the most important metric in health tech projects. Health tech project have high cost of mistake, and we must make sure recall is high.
